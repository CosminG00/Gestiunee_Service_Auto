# Gestiunee_Service_Auto

This C++ program contains all 4 Principles of OOP(abstraction, encapsulation, inheritence, polymmorpish) dealing with txt, binary, csv files, data mining, virtualisation

Using Economic and Programming knowledge I created a program that implies the management of a car service, focusing on the attributes of the 5 classes that I defined ("A ("Angajati" - Employees, "Masina" - Car, Client, "Programare" - Appoiment, "Factura" - Invoice, "ServiceAuto" - Car Service). I also provided the overload of many operators, giving meaning to the program by implementing methods calculating the value of the sales, that orders repairs according to need and cost etc.
